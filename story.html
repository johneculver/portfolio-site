                    <h2>My Story: From Clarinetist to Product Manager</h2>
                    <p>As a Principal Product Manager in the SaaS and mobile applications space, I work with cross-functional teams of discover, design, and deliver meaningful solutions to customers. Although building these solutions is important, I find that the most rewarding aspects of the job are fostering meaningful relationships, learning from peers, and helping others succeed.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                        <p>My path into product management was a unique one. Unlike many of my colleagues who have MBAs or software engineering backgrounds, I have Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in clarinet performance from Eastman and Carnegie Mellon. It was an enriching 6 years of learning and performing. After completing graduate school, I recognized that my burn rate exceeded the time that would be required to land a job in an orchestra. I needed to pivot.</p>

                    
                    <p>
                        With the guidance of a career counselor at my recent alma mater, we identified a potential starting point where music, creativity, and innovation intersect: Apple computers. I spent almost 2 years working at an Apple Store alongside a phenomenal group of peers. It was a great learning experience where I was able to make measurable impact, but I realized to grow I would have to eventually move out of retail. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, some former colleagues mentioned that Oracle had opened an office in Austin, TX and that they were hiring folks for inside sales/demand generation roles. After two rounds of interviews, the hiring manager extended an offer. I packed up a U-Haul and drove from Pittsburgh to Austin 4 weeks later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After learning several dozen 3-letter acronyms, a set of sound prospecting tactics, and what a “high-level conversation” meant, I was off to the races. Throughout the numerous conversations I had with prospects and customers, it became abundantly clear that I wanted to fully understand the problems the customer had and the ways we could solve them rather than just smiling, dialing, and creating sales opportunities. The music school “practice room” mindset was useful here; I took any extra time to read through articles on industry trends and find documentation on product system design. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I also sought the input of two colleagues in sales engineering roles on how to focus my development efforts. In addition to their advice, they suggested I move into a role like theirs. I applied to transfer to an applications sales engineering role. After 4 rounds of interviews, I was hired and moved out to the field to give solution demos in partnership with Account Executives. <aside>Fun side note: in preparation for round 3, I was asked to incorporate clarinet into my presentation. My Eastman School of Music colleague Rob Strebendt and I composed a piece to be played live with pre-recorded piano accompaniment over a marketing video for the product on which I was presenting. </aside>

                            I spent the next 6 years in Sales Engineering, where I learned about customer priorities across industries and collaborated with sales, product marketing, and product management. In the latter part of that timeframe, my work became more focused on high priority customers. I identified a challenging pattern in our conversations: I understood the problems they felt and knew what kind of user experience, systems design, and business considerations were needed to address these problems. But I only demoed existing product; my team did not build new product. I wanted to take my understanding of the customer and use it to prioritize and release great products that help them be successful.

                    <p>    
                        Right around this time, a peer forwarded my name to one of our product teams. They needed someone to deliver a demo to a major analyst firm that was evaluating competitive offerings in the team’s product category. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was so enjoyable to collaborate with and learn from the Product Owner, Director of Product Management, and Development Team as we evaluated how to best portray the solution in line with the 70+ requirements the analyst firm provided. We were thrilled when we heard the results of the analyst’s report: the team’s product was named a Leaders for the first time in this evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Collaborating with this team only furthered my interest in moving into product management, so I asked the team’s director for guidance on how to make the pivot. One of the best questions she asked me on our first call was “what would make you unique as a PM, and how would you demonstrate that?” I knew I cared about great user experiences and analytics, but I needed to find a way to back it up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After several months of applying more “practice room” focus to the Scrum.org PSPO1 Certification, the Oracle Analytics Cloud Certification, and a JavaScript course on Udemy, my mentor mentioned another team was hiring. The interview process included leaders and prospective peers from that team, and after several challenging rounds, I received an offer to move to my first Product Management role. With it came new things to learn, great people to work with, and ways to approach problems I would have never considered in my music school days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I continue the product management journey and beyond, I look forward to finding new ways to apply technology to problems that relate helping others succeed, even if their path is the one that is less traveled.
